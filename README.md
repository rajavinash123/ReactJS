# ReactJS
📂 Included Concepts:
🔧 useState Hook – Local state handling in interactive components like Counter.jsx

📦 Props – Data passed between components in LoginBtn.jsx, LogoutBtn.jsx

🔄 Conditional Rendering – Logic-based UI toggles inside ConditionalRendering.jsx

📤 State Lifting – Shared state example in StateLifting.jsx

🖱️ Event Handling – Button clicks and input interactions throughout components
✅  useEffect Hook Concepts You Have Learned So Far:
1. React Components
Building blocks of a React app.

You created components like TimerComp, DataFetcher, ResizeComp, and MultiEffectComp.

2. useState Hook
Used to store and manage dynamic values (like count, window width, API data).

Helps your component re-render when state changes.

3. useEffect Hook
Used to perform side effects (e.g., fetch API data, run timers, handle resize events).

Runs after component is rendered.

Can run:

once (on mount),

on specific value change (with dependency array),

with cleanup (on unmount).
